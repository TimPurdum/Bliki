## documentation.git
* URL: http://idn-git.idnetworks.com/git/documentation.git

A dead-end attempt, by Nick Acosta, to create a common store for internal documentation, in lieu of a wiki.  This repo should be deleted soon, unless someone deems it important.


## jms.git
* URL: http://idn-git.idnetworks.com/git/jms.git

The source code for the new .NET version of Jail Management.  See Mike Crawford for more information.


## master_3.4.git
* URL: http://idn-git.idnetworks.com/git/master_3.4.git

The 3.4 production version of the master solution.  The master solution contains the .NET projects for our public safety products (CAD, Mobile, RMS) and other common .NET assemblies.  When the master solution was moved from VSS to Git, only the development branch of the code (at the time, version 3.5) was moved.  The 3.4 branch, which had just gone into production, was kept in VSS.  After a couple years of headaches dealing with VSS, we moved the 3.4 code into Git as well, but we kept it in its own repository rather than attempting to merge it into the existing master.git repository.  See Allen Sharrer or Steven Doggart for more information.


## master.git
* URL: http://idn-git.idnetworks.com/git/master.git

The repostiory containing the master solution.  The master solution contains the .NET projects for our public safety products (CAD, Mobile, RMS) and other common .NET assemblies.  See Allen Sharrer or Steven Doggart for more information.


## puffinpapers.git
* URL: http://idn-git.idnetworks.com/git/puffinpapers.git

The repository for this website/document collection. Useful if the machine hosting Puffin Papers would happen to crash, or to see who changed what when.
