* Role: Maintains legacy JMS and legacy RMS
* Location: In the Ashtabula, OH office (Eastern Time)
* Hired: Nov. 3, 1987
* Preferred Medium: Trillian

Tim holds the honor of being the longest employed person in the company.  Only Doug Blenman Sr. has been here longer.  He has spent most of his time in recent years working on the Legacy JMS product as well as some of the legacy RMS modules.

## Mike Crawford
![](/uploads/idn-employees/mike-crawford-1.png)
* Department: Development
* Role: Sole developer of JMS.NET and Query Builder
* Location: In the Ashtabula, OH office (Eastern Time)
* Hired: Aug. 2010
* Preferred Medium: Trillian

He learned VB6 for his position while enlisted in the Marines.  After completing his service for the military, he got a job at IDN, working with Dave Z on the .NET rewrite of the JMS product.  After Dave Z quit, around 2016, Mike assumed full control of that JMS product.  While historically JMS has shared relatively little with the rest of the codebase, Mike has been making good progress, over the years, at bringing JMS closer into the fold with the rest of the public-safety products.

## Steve Doggart
![](/uploads/idn-employees/steven-doggart-1.png)
* Department: Development
* Role: Puffin
* Location: In the Ashtabula, OH office (Eastern Time)
* Hired: Dec. 6, 2010
* Preferred Medium: Slack

Before coming to IDN, he worked for for 13 years at TriTech, a CAD/RMS competitor.  Though he was hired here to work on CAD, after writing some alarm and emergency dispatch interfaces, he was tasked with the .NET rewrite of the Security module, and he hasn't been back on CAD since.  After working on security, he worked on the .NET rewrite of the Incidents module and then the rewrite of the Reviewals module.  He has also developed many of the common libraries and tools such as PageDoc, DB Upgrader, and Central Configuration.  He worked with Allen to establish shared code and practices, and with Mike Lawton to move us from Source Safe to Git.  He has lead the developer hiring and training process since 2016.

## Doug Ebbink
![](/uploads/idn-employees/doug-ebbink-1.png)
* Department: Sales & Delivery
* Role: Project Manager
* Location: Remote from Virginia Beach, VA (Eastern Time)
* Hired: Nov. 2005
* Preferred Medium: Trillian

Before coming to IDN, he was a sheriff's deputy.  We hired him to be a project manager (someone who oversees the implementation of promised new-features, installation, training, data conversion, and go-live for new customers).  He handles all new Livescan and JMS customers in VA.

## Pat Foster
![](/uploads/idn-employees/pat-foster-1.png)
* Department: Sales & Delivery
* Role: Project Manager
* Location: Remote from Saint Clair, MI (Eastern Time)
* Hired: Jan. 2011
* Preferred Medium: Trillian

Before coming to IDN, he was a police officer.  We hired him to be a project manager (someone who oversees the implementation of promised new-features, installation, training, data conversion, and go-live for new customers).  He mainly handles all the new biometrics customers in MI.

## Michael Henderson
![](/uploads/idn-employees/michael-henderson-1.png)
* Department: Development
* Role: Sole developer of IJIS
* Location: In the Ashtabula, OH office (Eastern Time)
* Hired: Mar. 1998
* Preferred Medium: Trillian

He worked for a short time as a developer with Doug Blenman Jr. at the Cleveland Clinic, and then Doug recommended him for a job with IDN, so he started working for IDN around the same time as Doug.  He has worked independently on IJIS for many years, and, since IJIS, and other related biometric products share very little with the rest of the codebase, he's had little need to work closely with the rest of the team.  Despite looking quite sad in this picture, he's remarkably jolly.

## Dean Hollister
![](/uploads/idn-employees/dean-hollister-1.png)
* Department: Development
* Role: Sole developer of Fingerroll
* Location: In the Ashtabula, OH office (Eastern Time)
* Hired: Jan. 2000
* Preferred Medium: Trillian

Dean has worked independently on the Fingerroll product for many years.  Since Fingerroll historically has shared very little with the rest of the codebase, Dean has rarely had much need to interact with the rest of the team.  That should be changing shortly, though, once the .NET rewrite of Fingerroll gets underway.  Doug wants the Puffins to work closely with Dean to rewrite Fingerroll, making the new version share as much of the common libraries and architecture as possible.

## Tim Jay
![](/uploads/idn-employees/tim-jay-1.png)
* Department: Development
* Role: Puffin 
* Location: Remote from the Eugene, OR area (Pacific Time)
* Hired: Oct. 21, 2019
* Preferred Medium: Slack

He is originally from Wisconson, and he graduated with an associates degree in IT.  Prior to coming here, he ran his own company providing the premiere bot software for some online game that no one has ever heard of (Magic The Gathering Online).

## Alex Jensen
![](/uploads/idn-employees/alex-jensen-1.png)
* Department: Sales & Delivery
* Role: Data conversions
* Location: Remote from the Cleveland, OH area (Eastern Time)
* Hired: Nov. 2017
* Preferred Medium: Slack

He started his career by being trained for a network administration role for the Marines.  After completing his service for the military, had several technical jobs, eventually settling into data analyst role.  He had three or four years of professional experience with SSIS and SSRS before coming here.  Alex handles all the data conversions necessary to help new customers import all the data from their prior vendor's software into ours.

## Joe Kausits
![](/uploads/idn-employees/joe-kausits-1.png)
* Department: Development
* Role: Puffin
* Location: Remote from the Youngstown, OH area (Eastern Time)
* Hired: May 7, 2018
* Preferred Medium: Slack

He originally went to school for Aerospace engineering, but wasn't enjoying it.  He discovered an interest in software development while taking some programming classes.  Eventually, he went back to school and graduated with a BS in CS.  He came to IDN shortly after graduating.  He has worked on several important internal tools, like the Solution Integrity Checker, the Environment Initializer, and the statutes importer.  He has also done a lot of work on the Reviewals and Incidents moduals.

## Mike Lawton

* Department: Development
* Role: Sole developer of Civility
* Location: Remote from the Roanoke, VA area (Eastern Time)
* Hired: Apr. 1, 2015
* Preferred Medium: Slack

He worked as a developer for Dapro, a small family-run RMS vendor which catered to VA.  IDN aquired Dapro in 2015, so Mike joined us through that acquisition.  Since joining IDN, he has continued to work almost exclusively on the Civil Processing products that he began at Dapro, before the acquisition.  He was instrumental in the push for the adoption of Git as our solution for source control.

## Gene Layton
![](/uploads/idn-employees/gene-layton-1.png)
* Department: Development
* Role: Sole developer of CAD
* Location: Remote from the Charlotte, NC area (Eastern Time)
* Hired: Jun. 2005
* Preferred Medium: Trillian

Before coming here, Gene worked for Geac, a CAD competitor.  He was hired to help us create our own CAD product, since we didn't have one yet.  Initially, there was one other developer working with him on it, but he quit within the first year or two.  Gene has been working independently, more or less, on CAD ever since.

## Brandon Libbey

* Preferred Medium: Slack

He graduated with a BS in IT.  While working, he taught himself C# and then got a job as a C# developer for a few years before coming here.  He helped implement the FPD encoding, but most of his work has been on the .NET rewrite of the Citations module.

## Mike Sansone
![](/uploads/idn-employees/mike-sansone-1.png)
* Department: Development
* Role: Honorary Puffin, maintains legacy RMS
* Location: Remote from the San Francisco, CA area (Pacific Time)
* Hired: Apr. 2007
* Preferred Medium: Trillian

He graduated with a BS in CS.  He was originally from Erie, PA, and worked in the Ashtabula office for the first couple years.  When he wanted to move to another state, the company decided to allow him to work remotely.  He has worked in many areas of RMS, both in the legacy code as well as in .NET.

## Allen Sharrer
![](/uploads/idn-employees/allen-sharrer-1.png)
* Department: Development, Sales & Delivery, Support
* Role: Honorary Puffin, manages builds, QA, and deployments
* Location: In the Ashtabula, OH office (Eastern Time)
* Hired: Mar. 12, 2007
* Preferred Medium: Slack

He started as a developer working with Dave Z on legacy RMS and ImageNet. After six months, or so, he took over the Mobile product.  He was the sole Mobile developer until Oct. 2014, when he was promoted to being the manager of the support department.  That role never quite materialized though, and in 2019 Ryan Thompson was made the manager of the support department.  So, while Allen does do a lot of second-tier support, he also still has one foot in development.  He still actively works in the code, maintaining a number of products and interfaces.  On the support side of things, he spends most of his time handling the new-installs and upgrades.  On the development side of things, he spends most of his time working on the internal tools we use for building, QAing, and deploying the products.  Allen has been instrumental in much of the progress which has been made to standardize and share our code and workflow. 

## Andy Stevenson
![](/uploads/idn-employees/andy-stevenson-1.png)

## Matt Stoffel
![](/uploads/idn-employees/matt-stoffel-1.png)
* Department: Support
* Role: First Tier Support

## Chase Sweet
![](/uploads/idn-employees/chase-sweet-1.png)
* Department: Sales & Delivery, Support
* Role: Data conversions
* Location: Remote from the Lexington, VA area (Eastern Time)
* Hired: Apr. 1, 2015
* Preferred Medium: Slack

He graduated with a BS in CS.  He worked as a support technician for Dapro, a small family-run RMS vendor which catered to VA.  IDN aquired Dapro in 2015, so Chase joined us through that acquisition.  Upon joining IDN, he continued in that tech support role, supporting the Dapro customers.  Once all the Dapro customers are transitioned to IDN software, that need will go away, but he also now provides support for Livescan.  He does all of the DaPro-to-IDN data conversions and he has started to help Alex Jensen with some of the non-Dapro conversions as well.

## Ryan Thompson
![](/uploads/idn-employees/ryan-thompson-1.png)
* Department: Support
* Role: Manager
* Location: In the Ashtabula, OH office (Eastern Time)
* Hired: Oct. 2008
* Preferred Medium: Trillian

He started in first-tier tech support, but he later became the defacto head of the support department, handling mainly the second-tier calls, and spending much of his time doing IT, both for us as well as for new-customer-installs.  After five or six years of doing support, he transferred to the development team, working with Derek Tapper on the biometrics products (primarily Finger ID and the Photo Capture module).  He did that for 5 years until he was promoted in 2019 to being the manager of the support department.  He often helps Eric out with IT issues.

## Dan Walker
![](/uploads/idn-employees/dan-walker-1.png)
* Department: Development
* Role: Puffin in spirit
* Location: Remote from Reno, NV (Pacific Time)
* Hired: Apr. 11, 2016
* Preferred Medium: Slack

Before coming to IDN, Dan worked as a C++ developer for a company which created diagnostic software for hardware vendors, like Dell.  He started as a member of the Puffins, working on the IBR export logic for VA.  During that time, he and Josh Weeks helped to convince the company to switch from VB to C#.  However, once the IBR export was complete, he was assigned to the ProQA interface for CAD.  Shortly thereafter, he was reassigned to work with Mike Lawton on the Civil Processing project for Fairfax County SO.  He has been working on that project ever since, and has yet to get back to working with the rest of the team.  Doug plans to reassign him back to puffin-products once the Fairfax project is complete.

## Helen Wiedenfeld

* Department: Sales & Delivery
* Role: Project Manager
* Location: Remote from the Chicago, IL area (Central Time)
* Hired: Sometime after Dec. 2010
* Preferred Medium: Trillian

Before coming to IDN, Helen was a dispatcher (and somewhat of a system administrator) for Northwest Central Dispatch (NWCDS), a big new account for us, at the time.  Shortly after they went live, we hired her to be a project manager (someone who oversees the implementation of promised new-features, installation, training, data conversion, and go-live for new customers).  She mainly handles all the new CAD customers.  While Doug Jr. is the official the product manager for CAD, sinch Helen has a lot of dispatch experience, she often unoficially also helps out in that role.   She also helps out at many of the trade shows.

## John Wheelock

## Corey Yovich
![](/uploads/idn-employees/corey-yovich-1.png)
* Department: Sales & Delivery
* Role: Project Manager
* Location: In the Ashtabula, OH office (Eastern Time)
* Hired: Nov. 2008
* Preferred Medium: Trillian (occasional Slack user)

He was initially hired as a first-tier support technician, but he later moved up to project managment role (someone who oversees the implementation of promised new-features, installation, training, data conversion, and go-live for new customers).  He mainly handles all the new Mobile/Message-Switch customers.  He also helps out at all the trade shows.  He's often on the road, often with Doug Jr.

## Eduard Zaslavsky
![](/uploads/idn-employees/eduard-zaslavsky-1.png)
* Department: Development
* Role: Sole developer of Mobile and the Message Switch
* Location: Remote from the Montreal, Canada area (Eastern Time)

He inherited the Mobile product from Allen Sharrer (who was transferring to the support department) and the Message Switch from Kevin Wall (who had recently quit).  He has been working on that, along with some occasional CAD interfaces, ever since.  Doug asked Eduard in 2018 to start working on a Xamarin app to supplement our Mobile and CAD products, so he is currently leading the charge on the Xamarin development.

# Prior Personnel of Particular Pertinence
## Jim Stevens
![](/uploads/idn-employees/jim-stevens-1.png)
* Department: Development
* Role: RMS developer
* Employed: 2008 - 2015

He was hired as a developer to work with Dave Z on the RMS product.  He worked on many RMS related projects prior to any rewrite of it into .NET.  For instance, he worked on some of the crash and citation interfaces, the SOAP-mode framework, and he created the legacy RMS Explorer.  Of most the significance, though, is that for the last year or two, he worked closely with Steve Doggart on the .NET rewrite of the incident module (at the time, just for Virginia).  Steve worked mostly on the architecture and editable PageDoc framework, while Jim worked on the actual VA incident module.  So, while Steve was involved with the in the implementation of it, and worked closely with Jim on it, much of the code for the form-on-screen code-behind, data-access, and the original database schema, were implemented by Jim.  He also worked with Steve to create the regex-based address parser (niether of them knew regex at the time, but both were experts in it by the time they were done).

## Derek Tapper
![](/uploads/idn-employees/derek-tapper-1.png)
* Department: Development, Sales & Delivery
* Role: Biometrics Product Manager
* Employed: Mar. 2007 - Nov. 2018

He was initially hired as a developer, working with Dave Z on ImageNet and JMS.NET.  He later did a lot of development work on the auto-updater engine and some of the biometrics products.  in Jun. 2014, he was promoted to being the product manager for all of the biometrics products.  After that, until he left, Dean Hollister, Ryan Thompson, and Carlos Sanchez worked closely with him as developers for those products.  After Derek left, Doug Blenman Jr. assumed his responsibilities as the manager for the biometric products.

## Dave Zatkiewicz
![](/uploads/idn-employees/dave-zatkiewicz-1.png)
* Department: Development
* Role: Lead developer for multiple products
* Employed: Oct. 1999 - May 2016

He lead the development of JMS, RMS, and ImageNet for many years.  Prior to Dave Z, RMS only supported OH.  He oversaw the addition of support for IL, MI, and CO.  He also oversaw the addition of mobile-support in RMS via the SOAP-mode option.  He later lead the effort to rewrite JMS in .NET.  He created the forerunner to PageDoc (loosely referred to as IDNPage) as well as a rudimentary form-on-screen data-entry framework.  He promoted the use of SOAP web services over the use of MSMQ (as was being used by the CAD and Mobile team).  He was instrumental in porting the legacy products from Btrieve to Access.  He also created Query Builder and the original Reviewals module (then called Reports Management, or Review-and-Approve).
